This file is the CodeBook and describes the data in the tidy data set.

Excerpt taken from the provided documentation about the experiment (See README.txt):

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

====
For the purposes of the tidy data set, we extracted only those features that contained either the word "mean" or "std" is their description.  The list is as follows:

 [1] "SubjectID":
 This is the ID code of the subject wearing the smartphone in the experiment.
 
 [2] "ActivityID":
 This is the ID code of the activity being performed by the subject.
 
 [3] "DescriptiveLabels" 
 This is the activity label (in English) corresponding to the ActivityID.
 
The remaining variables are described in more detail in the file "features_info.txt"
However, it should be noted that each of these features have been normalized to the range of [-1,1] and are thus unitless.  This list is as follows:
