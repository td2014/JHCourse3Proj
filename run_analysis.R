#

trainData = read.csv

#
# Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#

#
# Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#

#
# Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#

#
# Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, 
# independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
